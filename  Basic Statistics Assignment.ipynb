    "1)Descriptive Statistics:  Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe data in a meaningful way, providing a concise overview of the main characteristics of the data. Some common descriptive statistics include:\n",
    "        \n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency: These statistics describe the center or average of a data set. Examples include the mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "Example: Calculating the average age of students in a classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability: These statistics measure the spread or dispersion of data points around the center. Examples include the standard deviation and range.\n",
    "Example: Determining the spread of test scores in a class to understand how much variation there is among student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency Distributions: These are tabulations that show how often different values occur in a dataset.\n",
    "Example: Creating a histogram to show the distribution of grades obtained by students in an exam.    \n",
    "\n",
    "2)Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "    Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions or make predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. They involve hypothesis testing, estimation, and making inferences based on probability theory. Some examples include:\n",
    "        \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Testing: This is used to test a specific hypothesis about a population parameter, based on a sample from the population.\n",
    "Example: Testing whether a new drug has a statistically significant effect on reducing blood pressure compared to a placebo in a clinical trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Intervals: These provide a range of values within which we are reasonably confident the population parameter lies.\n",
    "Example: Calculating a 95% confidence interval for the average weight of all apples produced in an orchard based on a sample of apples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression Analysis: Regression is used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable.\n",
    "Example: Analyzing the relationship between hours of study and exam scores to predict how much a student's exam score might increase with additional study time.\n",
